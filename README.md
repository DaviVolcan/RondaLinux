# RondaLinux - Buildroot BeagleBone Embedded Linux Study Project

## 📋 Overview

**RondaLinux** is a **study project** designed to **deepen knowledge and understanding** of **embedded Linux systems**. Through hands-on experience building a custom distribution with **Buildroot** for the **BeagleBone** platform, this project serves as a comprehensive learning journey into the complexities of embedded systems development.

## 🚀 Getting Started


### Project Structure Commands
```bash
# Create new package
./scripts/create-package.sh sensor-daemon

# Add kernel patch
./scripts/add-kernel-patch.sh driver-fix.patch

# Update configuration
make -C buildroot O=$PWD/output menuconfig
```

## 🛠️ Useful Commands

### Environment Setup
Since we're using an out-of-tree Buildroot project, it's important to properly set up the environment:

```bash
# Set BR2_EXTERNAL for the current session
export BR2_EXTERNAL=/home/daviv/pessoal/RondaLinux/br-external
```

Note: While you could add this to your shell profile (.bashrc or .zshrc), it's recommended to set it per session as you might work with multiple Buildroot projects.

### Common Build Commands
```bash
# Configure the build system
make menuconfig

# Save current configuration as default
make savedefconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=/home/daviv/pessoal/RondaLinux/br-external/configs/bbg_volcan_defconfig

# Load the default configuration
BR2_EXTERNAL=/home/daviv/pessoal/RondaLinux/br-external/ make bbg_volcan_defconfig

# Download all sources (this can take considerable time)
make source

# Build the system (using all available CPU cores)
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Build Analysis Commands
```bash
# Generate dependency graph (requires graphviz)
make graph-depends
make graph-build

# Generate build time visualization (requires python-matplotlib)
make graph-duration

# To view the generated graphs
xdg-open output/graphs/build.pdf
xdg-open output/graphs/deps.pdf
xdg-open output/graphs/duration.pdf
```

### Download Optimization

To optimize the download process and reuse sources across different Buildroot projects, we use a global download folder. This approach has several benefits:
- Reuse of downloaded sources across multiple Buildroot projects
- Reduced storage usage
- Faster project setup when sources are already cached

You can set up the global download directory by adding this to your shell configuration or setting it before running make:
```bash
# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/buildroot-dl
# Set global download directory
export BR2_DL_DIR=~/buildroot-dl
```

Additionally, we're using a nearby GNU mirror to improve download speeds. This significantly reduces the time needed to fetch source packages from GNU mirrors.
