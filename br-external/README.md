# RondaLinux - Buildroot BeagleBone Embedded Linux Study Project

## 📋 Overview

**RondaLinux** is a **study project** designed to **deepen knowledge and understanding** of **embedded Linux systems**. Through hands-on experience building a custom distribution with **Buildroot** for the **BeagleBone** platform, this project serves as a comprehensive learning journey into the complexities of embedded systems development.

*The project name comes from my German Shepherd dog, Ronda - a purely fun decision that adds personality to this technical learning adventure!* 🐕

The primary goal is **knowledge acquisition** across multiple domains: understanding operational requirements of embedded distributions, mastering the decision-making process in system architecture, exploring hardware-software integration, and developing proficiency in low-level programming.
